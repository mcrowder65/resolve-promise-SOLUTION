Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed the exercise and were able to solve it.

Let's solve the exercise

```js
utilities
  .getDogBreeds()
  .then(getDogNames)
  .then(console.log)
```

Great, I hope that wasn't too bad.

If you noticed here, we actually have `.then` called twice here. This is called promise chaining.

We'll go more into depth about promise chaining in the next video, see you there!
